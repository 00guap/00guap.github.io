[COLOR red][B]Online Release Version 1.0.64[/B][/COLOR]
- Removed Settings->Features->"Open Extras When Selecting". Replaced with "Special Open Actions" within same Features tab.
- Removed "Use Minimal Media Info" setting.
- Added "More Like This" recommendations to Extras window and context menu of Movies and TV Shows.
- Added rudimentary support for "Special" episodes. I see no use in including these, as there will almost never be sources for playback. But I had the request so here they are. Also, you will not be able to mark them as watched within Fen Light.
- Added "guest star" cast members for TV Show episodes. Will include additional cast appearing in that specific episode. Requested.
- Other changes/fixes.
