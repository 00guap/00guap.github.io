[COLOR red][B]Online Release Version 1.0.72[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Single Episode Lists" settings category. Some re-organizing of settings.
- Added Settings->Content->Widgets->"Refresh Widgets on Timer". Enable this, set a timer value, and FenLight will refresh your widgets when the timer is due. Off by default. Also added boolean to enable/disable Notifications when this occurs. If you use "random" widgets (made using the various methods in Fen Light) then you will need to set a value here or else the random widgets will only show fresh random content on each Kodi start.
- Bifurcated (thanks for the new word) Minimum Size setting into movies/episodes for filtering results.
- Other changes/fixes.
