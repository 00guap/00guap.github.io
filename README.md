RULES FOR SUBMITTING ISSUES:
Pretty simple, 3 rule system...

1. If submitting a bug report, you must include a relevant kodi log.
2. If submitting a feature request, you must only include one request in your submission. You must also only have one active (non closed) request at a time.
3. Use your manners. There's almost a 100% chance that I don't actually WANT to implement your request. If you can't use a please or a thankyou I'll just delete your Issue.

Failure to follow these 3 simple rules will result in your issue being deleted. No exceptions.
